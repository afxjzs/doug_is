Have you ever wanted to compare two products quickly and effectively? Google has a simple trick for that. Just type in the name of the two products you want to compare, separated by "vs", and Google will do the rest.

For example, if you want to compare the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S4, just type "iPhone 5 vs Samsung Galaxy S4" into the Google search bar. Google will then provide a side-by-side comparison of the two products, including their specifications, price, and reviews.

<div
	style={{
		display: "grid",
		gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(2, 1fr)",
		gap: ".5rem",
	}}
>
	<Image src="/nodejs.jpg" width="300" height="404" alt="Yelp" />
	<Image src="/zapier.jpg" width="300" height="404" alt="Yelp" />
</div>
This trick is not limited to products. You can also use it to compare people, places,
ideas, and more. The possibilities are endless.

So the next time you're stuck deciding between two options, just remember: Google's "vs" feature is your friend.
