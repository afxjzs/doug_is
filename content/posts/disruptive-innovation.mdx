Disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market-leading firms, products, and alliances.

## What is Disruptive Innovation?

The theory of disruptive innovation, introduced in these pages in 1995, has proved to be a powerful way of thinking about innovation-driven growth. Many leaders of small, entrepreneurial companies praise it as their guiding star; so do many executives at large, well-established organizations, including Intel, Southern New Hampshire University, and Salesforce.com.

The theory’s core concepts, and the rich array of phenomena the theory has been used to explain, have been the subject of a wide range of books and articles, including a number of pieces by us. And the theory is being taught in business schools around the world.

But as with any theory, it’s not perfect. It can be easy to misuse or misunderstand it, leading to undesired outcomes. We have seen this happen and have since strived to eliminate these misunderstandings.

## Examples of Disruptive Innovation

1. **Uber**: Uber, the ride-sharing app used worldwide, is a perfect example of a disruptive innovation. The company did not follow the path of improving services for the existing customers of traditional taxi services, but instead offered a whole new service that directly competed with taxi cabs.

2. **Netflix**: Netflix is another great example of disruptive innovation. With its streaming services, it was able to disrupt the traditional DVD rental industry, causing giants like Blockbuster to go out of business.

3. **Airbnb**: Airbnb is a disruptive innovation in the hotel industry. It did not start by taking customers from hotels directly, but instead offered a different approach to lodging and attracted a new market segment that was not being served by traditional hotels.

In conclusion, disruptive innovation is not just about technology or invention but about the strategy and business model that come with it. It's about creating value for a new market segment and eventually disrupting the existing market.
